# Title : canada_weather

# Description : 
A Java Swing project that allows a user to view the weather forecast for a list of Canadian cities listed on the GUI. The data is parsed from the BBC weather website, and is relayed onto the GUI when a city is selected.

# Installation :

Most of the files I've written for this project is in the /src/ directory. The /Test/ directory contains a Unit Testing class that tests the connection as well as testing the parsing of the data that has been parsed in from the RSS feed. Regarding the core Java files, they are located in /Model/ directory. The parser and the data type is located here. Lastly, the files related to the UI are located in the /UI/ directory. Both form files are located here.

To download the project, download and unzip the files. 

# Running The Programme:

Open the project with an IDE. We can start by running the Unit Test class located in /Test/ in order to check our connections. Once those tests pass, we can proceed to run the MainView.form file, which will initialize the main GUI as written in the Java Swing project. From there, the menu to select cities will appear they can be selected to view the forecast details.
